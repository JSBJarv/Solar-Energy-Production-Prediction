# Solar-Energy-Production-Prediction
Prediction of Solar Energy Output using Logistic Growth and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
- Applied Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to forecast 30 days kWh output trend in a solar cell energy production.
- Utilized the concept of logistic growth to predict the duration of charging the solar cell system to 500 kWh given different average temperature per season.
- Applied linear regression to predict the the kWh output based on temperature.
