# Solar-Energy-Production-Prediction
Prediction of Solar Energy Output using Logistic Growth and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
o Applied Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to forecast 30 days kWh output trend in a solar cell energy production.
o Utilized the concept of logistic growth to predict the duration of charging the solar cell system to 500 kWh given different average temperature per season.
o Applied linear regression to predict the the kWh output based on temperature.
